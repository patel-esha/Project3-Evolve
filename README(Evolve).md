# Evolve
The following project can be ran by downloading each of the CSV files, and running the data structure header files alongside the main.cpp file. 
Once you run the main.cpp several number options will pop-up. Pick a number to test the different functions defined in the header files.

*Make sure the .csv files are placed in the right directory*

Happy coding!
